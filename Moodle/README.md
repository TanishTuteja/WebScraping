# Project 1 : Moodle Login

This simple program uses Selenium Python binding to automate the login into Moodle, provided the user credentials.

The script opens the Moodle website in Chrome, fills in the given user credentials, solves the captcha and logs the user in.

## Running the script:

In this (Moodle) directory, run the following:

```
python ./moodleLogin.py <username> <password>
```

Here,

`username: Your Moodle login username`

`password: Your Moodle login password`
